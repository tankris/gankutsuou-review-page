      <p>Dear <strong class="user"></strong>,</p>
      <p>
        GGankutsuou, or "The King of the Cavern", is a romance anime with a dab
        of sci-fi. Released in 2004 and made by Studio Gonzo.

        Watching this anime definitely felt like a breath of fresh air in
        comparison to the atypical storylines written for the mainstream ones.
        Gankutsuou shines where others lack, through a thought-provoking tale
        and fleshed out characters.

        As seen in the above poster, we have the protagonist (the child) and the
        mysterious Count (with the long hair). What initially starts off as a
        series of seemingly unrelated events, turns into a twisted nightmare
        stiched by fate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where this anime shines is its approach to character development. While
        the audience is presented with a very humble and well-spoken Count at
        the beginning, slowly throws shade on his inner voice as the story
        progresses.
      </p>

        The theme surrounding the characters is trust. The trust that is forged
        and manipulated to achieve a goal. That goal is slowly unravelled to the
        audience at a good pace.

        It is so gruesomely depicted in the series that it makes one question
        their own trust in others. To trust someone means to be vulnerable. To
        be vulnerable is what we all look for in our life. We look to be
        vulnerable without being taken advantage of. It is a beautiful thing
        really, trust. However, as we grow up, we notice that trust is taken
        advantage of many a time and that results in one receding into a shell.
        A shell that we have come to know as Adulthood. Adulthood is no good. As
        kids, we have always looked to become adults as we are then free to do
        what we want but what we didn't notice is that the price to pay is to be
        who one isn't. This is rather tragic and is very uncomfortably presented
        by the anime. What makes this anime stand out is the way the toy with
        the audience. The audience is always left hanging if our protagonist is
        being taken advantage of and is the count really looking after his
        wellbeing to him smiling and laughing as though he were satisfied taking
        advantage of the child. Not only does this constant swing in actions
        make us question the true objective of the Count but also makes us want
        to learn more about them just like the other characters within the
        program. This is fantastic as now the audience is one with the anime and
        not a spectator. Every action of the count enables us, the audience from
        judging the character that is the Count. This makes the anime stand out
        as we are invested in the protagonist as we all can relate to the boy.
        Where the anime also shines is not only as discussed above that it makes
        us invested but it also does a fantastic job at the pacing. The key
        points are revealed slowly but like a slow and melodic dance and not as
        a filler. So the story doesn't feel like it were a series of revelations
        but a single wave with highs that reveal and lows that make us question.
        This makes the pacing feel extremely natural and never forced at any
        point. The anime is based on Alexander Dumas's famous novel The Count of
        Monte Cristo. I haven't read the book and would definitely love to. It
        would be wonderful to see how the same sci-fi psychedelic romance anime
        compares to the source material. I'd like to leave you with a quote from
        the same anime that struck a chord with me - "When one is no longer able
        to trust others, is that when one truly becomes an adult?" - Ep. 15
